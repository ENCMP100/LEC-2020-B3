% This script demonstrates basic operations with variables and 
% built-in functions


% Initializing a variable with a numeric value
age = 17;

% Re-assigning another value to the same variable
age = 18;


% Incrementing the value of the variable
age = age + 1;


% Initializing two other variables
baseDailySalary = 78.50;
todayCommission = 7.75;

% Evaluating an expression and assigning it's value to another variable
todayPayment = baseDailySalary + todayCommission;


% Use of more operators
numWorkers = 12;

totalLabourCost = numWorkers * todayPayment; % multiplication

% Another way to do the same calculation
totalLabourCostComputedAnotherWay = numWorkers * (baseDailySalary + todayCommission);

% Let's list the details of variables that are in the workspace on the
% command window
whos


% converting the age to an unsigned 8-bit integer and assigning it to
% another variable
age2 = uint8(age);


% Demonstrate effects of te format command

format short
value = pi  % should show value with 4 decimal places

format long
value = pi  % should show value with more decimal places

format compact
value = pi % should produce less line spacing in the command window

format loose
value = pi % should produce more line spacing in the command window

format % this brings back the default behaviour
value = pi


% More Numeric Operators
a = 8;
b = 4;
a/b  % divided by. The result is 2
a\b  % divided into. The result is 0.5
a^2   % Exponent.
-a    % Negation.


% some basic commands
clear a % deletes the variable a from the workspace
clear   % clears all variables from the workspace
clc     % clear the command window
exit    % closes MATLAB
